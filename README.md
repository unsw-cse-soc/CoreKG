----CoreKG: a Knowledge Lake Service-------------

With Data Science continuing to emerge as a powerful differentiator across industries, organisations are now focused on transforming their private and open data into actionable insights. This task is challenging as in today's knowledge-, service-, and cloud-based economy, businesses accumulate massive amounts of data from a variety of sources.
In this context, organizing vast amount of data gathered from various private/open data islands, i.e. Data Lake, will facilitate dealing with a collection of independently-managed datasets (from relational to NoSQL), diversity of formats and non-standard data models.
The rationale behind a Data Lake is to store raw data and let the data analyst decide how to cook/curate them later. In this paper, we present the notion of Knowledge Lake, i.e. a contextualized Data Lake. The Knowledge Lake will provide the foundation for big data analytics by automatically curating the raw data in the Data Lake and to prepare them for deriving insights. We present CoreKG -an open source Data and Knowledge Lake service- which offers researchers and developers a single REST API to organize, curate, index and query their data and metadata over time. CoreKG manages multiple database technologies (from Relational to NoSQL) and offers a built-in design for data curation, security and provenance.
