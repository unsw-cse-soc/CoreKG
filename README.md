----CoreDB: a Data Lake Service-------------

CoreDB is an open source complete Database Service that powers multiple relational and NoSQL (key/value, document and graph stores) databases-as-a-service for developing Web data applications. 
CoreDB enables analysts to build a data lake, create relational and/or NoSQL datasets within the data lake and CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) and query entities in those datasets. 
CoreDB exposes the power of Elasticsearch, a search engine based on Apache Lucene (https://lucene.apache.org/), to support a powerful index and full-text search.
CoreDB has a built-in design to enable top database security threats (Authentication, Access Control and Data Encryption) along with Tracing and Provenance support.
 CoreDB weave all these services together at the application layer and offers a single REST API to organize, index and query the data and metadata in a data lake.
